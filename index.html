            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><strong>Hey there!</strong> I’m <strong class="highlight">Daradarani Patience AWE</strong>, a passionate web developer on a mission to solve problems and make the web a more exciting place. My love for coding started back in <strong>2019</strong> when I took web development as an elective under entrepreneurship. I still remember the thrill of writing my first lines of <span class="html-tag">HTML</span> and seeing them come to life—it was pure magic!</p>
        
            <p>Since then, I’ve had my ups and downs—learning <span class="html-tag">HTML</span>, getting a taste of <span class="css-tag">CSS</span>, and even building my first web page with just <span class="html-tag">HTML</span>. But life had its challenges, from lack of a laptop to juggling academics. Despite everything, the fire for web development <em>kept burning in my heart</em>.</p>
        
            <p>Fast forward to <strong>2021</strong>: I finally got my hands on a laptop and dove back into coding, balancing it with my studies. <span class="larger-text">I’m proud</span> to say my hard work paid off, and now I have a CGPA of over <strong class="highlight">4.0</strong>! With my IT internship, I found a chance to sharpen my skills and dive deeper into web development, even when access to resources was limited.</p>
        
            <p>Now, thanks to the <strong class="plp">Power Learn Project</strong> August Cohort, I’m on an exciting new journey. I’m determined to use this opportunity to reach my goal of becoming a software engineer, bridging the gap between industry and academia, and creating innovative solutions to everyday problems.</p>
        
            <p><em>I don’t just want to study engineering—I want to use it as a tool to make a real impact.</em> This is just the beginning, and I’m ready to take on whatever comes next!</p>
