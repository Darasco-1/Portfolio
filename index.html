            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I’m Daradarani Patience AWE, a passionate web developer on a mission to solve problems and make the web a more exciting place. My love for coding started back in 2019 when I took web development as an elective under entrepreneurship. I still remember the thrill of writing my first lines of HTML and seeing them come to life—it was pure magic!

                Since then, I’ve had my ups and downs—learning HTML, getting a taste of CSS, and even building my first web page with just HTML. But life had its challenges, from lack of a laptop to juggling academics. Despite everything, the fire for web development kept burning in my heart.
                
                Fast forward to 2021: I finally got my hands on a laptop and dove back into coding, balancing it with my studies. I’m proud to say my hard work paid off, and now I have a CGPA of over 4.0! With my IT internship, I found a chance to sharpen my skills and dive deeper into web development, even when access to resources was limited.
                
                Now, thanks to the Power Learn Project August Cohort, I’m on an exciting new journey. I’m determined to use this opportunity to reach my goal of becoming a software engineer, bridging the gap between industry and academia, and creating innovative solutions to everyday problems.
                
                I don’t just want to study engineering—I want to use it as a tool to make a real impact. This is just the beginning, and I’m ready to take on whatever comes next!
